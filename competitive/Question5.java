/*Problem Statement – Given a string S(input consisting) of ‘*’ and ‘#’. The length of the string is variable. 
The task is to find the minimum number of ‘*’ or ‘#’ to make it a valid string. 
the string is considered valid if the number of ‘*’ and ‘#’ are equal. The ‘*’ and ‘#’ can be at any position in the string.


Note : The output will be a positive or negative integer based on number of ‘*’ and ‘#’ in the input string.

(*>#): positive integer
(#>*): negative integer
(#=*): 0
Example 1:
Input 1:

###***   -> Value of S
Output :0  → number of * and # are equal
 *
